# FnMacTweak

A lightweight iOS Theos tweak for Fortnite iOS on Mac. Implements several QoL features to improve the keyboard & mouse experience.

## Features
Currently implements the following:
- Toggle pointer locking with `Left Option` key (unlocked by default on game load)
- Unlocks the 120 FPS setting (requires 120Hz display, due to VSync)
- Enables graphics preset selection (Low, Medium, High, Epic; 120 FPS limits to Medium)
- Custom options menu (press `P`) to adjust mouse sensitivity
- Mouse interactions with mobile UI

## Releases
Latest builds & source code can be found in the [releases](https://github.com/rt-someone/FnMacTweak/releases/) section.
